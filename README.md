i first created a public repository here on github and cloned it to git version control system (VCS) command tool then i thereafter added the folders into command before i pushed the cloned file to github again
i tested all api html method e.g GET, POST, PUT, PATCH api on the postman collection page and also i put it on the Environmental variable level before i exported it as a json file.
i located the folder path where i saved the json files of (collection, environment) using newman command tool to test the reliabilty of the json files
i thereby got the html extra report to verify the authenticity of the json data and i saved all files in the folder directory of the repository.
using jenkins software i was able to pull the github repository using  http option instead of ssh and i also copied and pasted the newman code that was used to test the authenticity of the json file.
Alas i was abe to build it to the final file format and everything worked absolutely well.
